# Artemis Phase 2 [SCI/UTIL]
This is a project done in the graduate Human Spaceflight Operations course at Texas A&amp;M University in Spring of 2022. The purpose of the project is to have a cohesive overall plan for phase 2 of the Artemis missions when a presence has been made on the Lunar surface.

I served as the Science & Utilization Flight Director throughout the course of this project.

## Assumptions
- The initial lunar habitat modules have been established
- Gateway has been established
- SCI/UTIL required architecture is readily available as needed on the lunar surface
- The necessary communication infrastructure is established

## Constraints
- Any required construction is completed, this will determine the onset of experimentation
- Astronaut work/rest balance and scheduling
- Lunar/Space environmental effects
- Nominal vs. off-nominal plan
